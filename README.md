# UbiForm Skeleton Key
> This is an Android app which acts as a Skeleton Key for the [UbiForm platform](https://github.com/J2G8W/UbiForm).


The repository gives an Android runnable app which allows users to control the interactions of components which make use of the [UbiForm Middleware platform](https://github.com/J2G8W/UbiForm).
In addition, it can be enabled to act as a notificaton publisher for all of the notifications on the Android device.
It is a part of my PartII Computer Science project at the University of Cambridge.

## Installation
Add the UbiForm library to the path app/libs/UbiForm (can be done with a soft link if UbiForm already exists elsewhere on the system)

Android:
Use Android Studio with CMake to build the project.
